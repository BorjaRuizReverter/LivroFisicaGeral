# Livro de Física Geral
This repository contains the chapters of a book that will probably be called **Física Geral**. This book is about Physics, but it will contain all the math tools needed to fully comprehend that Physics. 

After teaching Physics for more than 10 years in the federal university of Brazil, I think that this approach of mixing both Physics and Mathematics in a book may be useful since my teaching experience showed me the deep and somewhat worrying lack of knownlegde of brazilian pupils in these areas when they enter college.

As this book is adapted to brazilian students it is written in Portuguese. But potential translations to Spanish and English could be considered in the future.

With this book I do not intend to write an exhaustive compendium of Physics. This is because this book is aimed at 
helping students from the courses of Agronomy and Biology, which only find necessary to teach a general knownledge of Phycics. That is why the book is to be intitled Física Geral.
